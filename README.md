# random-cat-website
An website server that shows randomly generated cat images

The code for the website was taken from:
https://codepen.io/Chanadian/pen/jxRWvg

My plans for the website are:
- make an docker image for the node server able to host the code
- make a Jenkins pipeline which build, test and deploys the code
- deploy the code on my persona website with use of AWS
