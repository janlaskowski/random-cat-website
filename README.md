# random-cat-website
An website server that shows randomly generated cat images

The code for the website was taken from:
https://codepen.io/Chanadian/pen/jxRWvg

My plans for the website are:
- [x] design a website showing random cat images with possibility to get another random cat image with a button
- [x] make an docker image for the node server able to host the code
- [] deploy the code on my persona website with use of AWS
